This app keeps track of all the details that go into the combat stage in the space exploration board game Eclipse.

Features I'd like to add soon:
Telling you whether a dice can count as a hit
Missles
Rare Techs

Usage Notes:
You have to drag a dice to a ship in order to damage it. If you just hit next, the damage is gone.
